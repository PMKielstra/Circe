## No permit

The Scout Association doesn't let anyone run a camp without a Nights Away permit.  These are other people's children, after all.  [You can get more information here.](https://www.scouts.org.uk/volunteers/running-your-section/nights-away-and-camping/nights-away-permit-scheme/the-nights-away-permit-scheme/)

* I'll look at that!

## NAN filing

Before you can run a camp, you need to file a NAN form with your District Commissioner.  These are available on the Scout Association website, but for now you can use [this link.](https://cms.scouts.org.uk/media/11876/form-nan_june-2020.doc)
